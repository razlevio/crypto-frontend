# Next.js Crypto Rates App

This application features a Next.js frontend designed to display the most recent cryptocurrency data, sourced from a Nest.js backend service. The frontend includes a straightforward table that retrieves cryptocurrency information via the `/last` endpoint from the Nest.js backend. Each time a user visits the app's root (/) page, a fetch request is sent to the backend to obtain and display the latest cryptocurrency rates.

Furthermore, the Next.js frontend maintains a live connection with the Nest.js backend through WebSocket protocol. It utilizes a real-time provider component that listens for messages emitted by the Nest.js backend. These messages are dispatched to all connected clients following every successful execution of a cron job, which updates the Redis database with the latest data. Upon receiving an update signal, the frontend listener triggers a revalidation process for the clients. This process initiates a partial page refresh, effectively retriggering the fetch request to the backendâ€™s `/last` endpoint for the newest data.

## Features

- Live Cryptocurrency Rates UI: Display the latest cryptocurrency rates from a Nest.js backend.
- Real-time Updates: Utilize WebSocket for live updates of cryptocurrency rates without needing to refresh the page.
